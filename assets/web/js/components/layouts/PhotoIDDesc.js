        Need your photo for passport renewal or some official documents? Get
        them printed using our online templates that meet the requirements for
        each country. Please take note that this price is strictly for printing
        physical copies. You can also select softcopy for online submission
        purposes. If you are looking to take your photos in store (from $16),
        please head down to one of our outlets, where urgent photos can be
        printed ~30 mins. Please take note that passport photo-taking services
        will cost more than our online photo printing service.
